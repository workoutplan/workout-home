Overall, the goddess toning program is a unique and desperately needed addition to the world of women’s fitness. With the body goddess app, you can start tracking your workouts and meals, measuring results, and achieving your fitness goals, all with the help of your personal trainer. The goddess workout takes you into a difficulty level v zone where your ability to do what you want with your body meets the laws. Start at the top of your mat in mountain pose (stand tall with your big toes touching, heels slightly apart, hands at your sides, and turn your palms forward).
