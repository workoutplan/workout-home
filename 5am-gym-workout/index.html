Hey 5am gym its been a minute! Something came over me this morning when From pinterest.jp
I have had suggested to me that i should eat a small snack before my workout, but i’m just not hungry. Skincare, get ready with me, journaling, breakfast, gym workout (cardio &amp; abs) &amp; breakfast number 2. I workout at 5am, well in fairness i wake up at 5 and workout at 5:30 but close enough. Pros and cons of a 5am workout while fasting.
