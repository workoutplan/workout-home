Inspiralized My Postpartum Review of the BBG Workout Program From inspiralized.com
Bbg is a workout program that ranges in length, from eight weeks to 92 weeks. Yes, this program is not specifically postpartum centred and i don’t recommend it for early on in your postpartum fitness journey. I currently have 3 prenatal workouts and 1 postnatal that are live. Resistance training makes up the core of bbg.
