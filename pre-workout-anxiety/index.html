Using a personal trainer in the comfort of your own home will allow you to have a productive workout, without the fear of being judged by an entire gym full of people. You will get a touch of caffeine, plus the ingredients for a great pump. The issue is that during or before a workout, cortisol levels can rise and if you do live with panic or anxiety issues, you may find that increase can lead to an attack.
