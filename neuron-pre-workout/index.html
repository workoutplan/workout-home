Neuron | Peak Performance Activator From optimumefx.com
(2013) articulates how exercise promotes the growth of neurons in the ventral hippocampus, so people who exercise tend to be able to handle stress better. One of the challenges in studying exercise in muscle and lower motor neuron diseases is that the diseases are rare and heterogeneous and one type of exercise. Neuroscientists at oregon health and science university discovered that, in mice, even a short burst of exercise directly boosts the activation of a gene that increases connections between neurons in the learning area of the brain. This problem has been solved!
