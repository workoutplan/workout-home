The longer you exercise the lower your glycogen stores will become and in turn your energy. By adding carbs during a particularly long or arduous training session, you can shift your body&#39;s focus back to using energy rather than conserving it. I myself prefer gatorade with a fast absorbing whey protein isolate (always vanilla). Deep sea water, pickle juice, and hydrolyzed rice syrup solids are three of the best ingredients you can use.

The gatorade is great for replenishing glycogen (to an extent) during the workout thanks to the sugars, and the protein is mostly for supplying amino acids to the muscles.
