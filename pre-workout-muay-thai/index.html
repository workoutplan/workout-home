Bouts are scored using a 10 point system, meaning each round the winner is given 10 points, and the loser is given 9, or 8 points depending on how convincingly they were beaten during the round. It includes jump roping, running, and shadowboxing, which are all aerobic workouts. This is another bodyweight exercise that is very simple, which is no special equipment needed, and you can do it anywhere, anytime, and this would be very good for muay thai. I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, or if there&#39;s anyone who is more knowledgeable on supplements and nutrition that could give me some tips for energy.
