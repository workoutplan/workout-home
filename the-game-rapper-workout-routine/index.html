Perform the remaining exercises as straight sets, completing all the prescribed sets for one exercise. So you’ll do one set of a, rest, then one set of b, rest again, and repeat for all the prescribed sets. The workouts should focus on learning ideal movement patterns of fundamental lifts such as horizontal presses, vertical presses, horizontal pulls, vertical pulls, squats, hip hinges, and loaded carries. Just going with the flow depending on your current mood.
