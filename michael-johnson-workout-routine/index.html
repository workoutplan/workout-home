Mike Johnson Age Height Weight Bio Images Workouts and Diet From whywetrain.com
I started working out last year but had to stop because i stopped waking up so early. Michael johnson’s training for speed endurance was covered in detail very early in the blog, so i thought it would be interesting to review what he did for speed work or acceleration development. 4 x 20 yards of bounding. When he ran 3 reps in 43 seconds with 4 minutes rest, that, too was a confidence boosting workout to run with lactate.
