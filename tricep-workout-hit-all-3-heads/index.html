3 sets x 12&#43; reps (failure) this workout definitely favors the long head of the triceps, but you’re still going to get an awesome chest workout and workout all of the triceps. When performing exercises like rope pull downs, the shoulder is in an extended position and all 3 heads are working on concentrically moving the elbow into extension (straightening) while also eccentrically controlling the elbow into flexion (bending). The perfect triceps workout hits all 3 heads of the triceps, and places special emphasis on ensuring maximal stretch and complete contraction of the long head. Make sure your elbow is always pointing towards the ceiling, lower the dumbbell, getting a deep stretch for your triceps, and then go all the way back to the top.
