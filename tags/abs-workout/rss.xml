Superfood Energy Bites Savor the Best From savorthebest.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark energy so i ordered a pre workout called dark energy and it arrived today and i&#39;ve been reading the labels on it and it says not for human consumption research purposes only and it has been banned in the us and is illegal, however it says 1 scoop a day and says 400mg caffeine in one scoop, it&#39;s apparently illegal since it has dmaa and. While both contain dmaa, 1’3 volt delivers more energy and focus, while dark energy is more of a mood enhancer. Liftvault = 15% off at nutrition cartel. Same with the 150mg pre i was taking before, i feel almost no effects that most people seem to experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
